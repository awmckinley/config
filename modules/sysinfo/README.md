FastFetch and Neofetch are system information display tools that gather and present system information like hardware specs, OS details, and other system metrics in a visually appealing format through the command line. They typically display an ASCII art of the operating system's logo alongside system details such as CPU, RAM, kernel version, packages, uptime, and desktop environment information.
